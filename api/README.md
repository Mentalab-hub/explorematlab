# MATLAB-based API for Explore data acquisition

This API allows you to get the data directly from Explore device via MATLAB software. 

## Requirements

* MATLAB Instrument Control Toolboxâ„¢
* MATLAB SIMULINK

# How to run

* Pair Explore device with your computer
* Run setup.m to add needed paths to MATLAB
* Go to api folder
* The code "api_no_viz.m" gives you access to raw data.
* For EEG signal visualization in Simulink open and run "eeg_api_example.slx"
* For orientation data visualization in Simulink open and run "orn_api_example.slx"

# TO DO
Write changes needed for different devices (4ch/8ch)
